<p>Hey there!</p>

<p>Little background about me. I am orginally from India and came to USA for my masters. I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University, 
Pittsburg with Masters in Information Systems Management in 2014. The school experience was one of the best thing happened to my
professional career and it exposed me to various possibilities in technology related projects.</p> 

<p></p>After my graduation, I joined Nike as a Senior Data Science Engineer. Working at Nike has given me an exposure and working 
experience on Big Data and related technologies. In 2 years with Nike, I am fortunate to work on myriad of projects ranging from
migrating code from traditonal transactional based systems to Hadoop clusters to building data products using technologies such as
pig, hive, python, JAVA on UNIX platforms.</p>
