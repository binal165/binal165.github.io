<p>Hey there!</p>

<p>Little background about me. I am orginally from India and came to USA for my masters. I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University, 
Pittsburgh with Masters in Information Systems Management in 2014. The school experience provided me with a strong foundation in technology
and presented me with various opportunities to grow as a software professional in the technology industry.</p> 

<p>Currently, I am working as a Senior Data Engineer with Nike and leading their Big data initiatives to better understand customers, 
improve marketing efforts and fine-tune data-driven strategies. In two years with Nike, I have mastered and improved my skill-sets in big data and related
technologies by leading the innovation in driving Next Generation Analytics Platform and frameworks in the cloud. The various projects at Nike 
have exposed me to large-scale software development with emphasis on data analytics and high volume data processing.</p>
